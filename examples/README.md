# Run SpecForge Examples

This folder contains the examples of running SpecForge on different models. The scripts can be invoked by the following command:

```bash
bash ./<script-name>.sh [NUM_GPUS] [TP_SIZE]
```

We use the ShareGPT dataset for all the examples for now, but you can replace it with more robust datasets such as perfectblend, magpie-qwen2.5-pro-1m-v0.1, etc.
